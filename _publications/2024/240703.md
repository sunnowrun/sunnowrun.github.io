  We present an infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for quantum impurity problems, which directly works in the steady state. The method embraces the well-established infinite matrix product state algorithms with the recently developed GTEMPO method, and benefits from both sides: it obtains real-time Green's functions without sampling noises and bath discretization error, it is applicable for any temperature without the sign problem, and its computational cost is independent of the transient dynamics and does not scale with the number of baths. We benchmark the method on the finite-temperature equilibrium Green's function in the noninteracting limit against exact solutions and in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model against GTEMPO calculations. We also study the zero-temperature nonequilibrium steady state of an impurity coupled to two baths with a voltage bias, obtaining consistent particle currents with existing calculations. The method is ideal for studying steady-state quantum transport, and can be readily used as an efficient real-time impurity solver in the dynamical mean-field theory and its nonequilibrium extension.
