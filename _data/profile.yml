  <p>
    Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators (GTEMPO) provide a powerful approach for studying open quantum systems with fermionic environments, 
    capable of handling real-time nonequilibrium dynamics as well as both real-time and imaginary-time equilibration processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    GTEMPO is built upon the Feynmanâ€“Vernon influence functional approach, a powerful analytical framework for studying the dynamics of open quantum systems. 
    By exactly integrating out the bath, it leverages tensor network techniques to compute dynamic observables of the impurity. 
    As a robust and promising numerical method, GTEMPO is well-suited for investigating strong coupling physics and non-Markovian dynamics
